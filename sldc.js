// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis = "This stage requires gathering all specific details required for a new system and determining ideas for a prototype"

const design = "Developers will first outline the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects, such as its:User interfaces, System interfaces, Network and network requirements & Databases"

const implementation = "The development stage is the part where developers actually write code and build the application according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications."

const testingAndIntegration = "Software must be tested to make sure it doesn't include any bugs" 

const maintain = "Developers must now move into a maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users."
